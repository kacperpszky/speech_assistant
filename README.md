# Voice Command Assistant

This project is a basic Python application that listens to user commands and executes pre-programmed functions using the SpeechRecognition library. The assistant is designed to process voice input, recognize spoken commands, and respond accordingly. It supports multiple languages, allowing the assistant to not only understand but also reply to commands in the language set by the user.

* Voice Command Recognition: Utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to accurately capture and interpret voice commands.
* Customizable Responses: The assistant responds to recognized commands in the user's chosen language.
* Pre-programmed Functions: Executes various tasks based on specific voice commands, with the flexibility to add more commands as needed.
* Multilingual Support: Recognizes and replies in multiple languages as configured by the user.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Set up the language preferences for command recognition and responses.
3. Run the script and start interacting with the assistant through voice commands.

This project is an excellent starting point for those interested in creating voice-controlled applications or experimenting with speech recognition in Python.
